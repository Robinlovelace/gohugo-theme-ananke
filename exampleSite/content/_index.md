This is a hugo theme based on the [ananke theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/gohugo-theme-ananke/).

It contains example content that we used for our wedding.
You can see the resulting website here: https://www.katyrobin.com/
Minor changes were made to the ananke theme but we owe much to [@budparr](https://github.com/budparr).

Here you should find everything you need to know about our upcoming big event.
So you can focus on organising the event, not the website!

You could add some media content here, e.g.:

<audio controls>
  <source src="katy-robin-shout-out.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
Your browser does not support the audio element.
